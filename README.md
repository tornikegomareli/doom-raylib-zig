# DOOM on macOS (Raylib + Zig build system)

A port of the original DOOM released by id Software in 1997 to modern macOS Apple Silicon using Raylib for graphics/audio and Zig as the build system.

The original source code is untouched. All platform-specific code lives in `macdoom/`

## Status

Working:
- Rendering (320x200 software renderer → Raylib texture)
- Input (WASD + arrows, mouse)
- Sound effects (8-channel software mixer → Raylib AudioStream)
- Music (MUS→MIDI conversion, playback via macOS AudioToolbox DLS synthesizer)
- Single player

Not yet implemented:
- Multiplayer networking
- Fullscreen / Retina support

## Install via Homebrew

```
brew tap tornikegomareli/doom-raylib-zig https://github.com/tornikegomareli/doom-raylib-zig
brew install macdoom
```

Then run:

```
macdoom
```

The shareware `doom1.wad` is installed automatically. No extra setup needed.

## Building from Source

Requirements:
- macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon or Intel)
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) 0.15+
- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) 5.x (`brew install raylib`)
- `doom1.wad` (shareware) in the `macdoom/` directory

```
cd macdoom
zig build
./zig-out/bin/macdoom
```

You can also specify custom raylib paths (e.g. on Intel Macs):

```
zig build -Draylib-include-path=/usr/local/include -Draylib-lib-path=/usr/local/lib
```

DOOM's platform abstraction is clean the game logic (`D_*`, `G_*`, `P_*`, `R_*`, `S_*`, `W_*`, `Z_*`) calls into 5 `I_*` interface functions for video, sound, timing, input, and networking. This port replaces only those 5 files.

## 64-bit porting notes

The original code assumes `sizeof(int) == sizeof(void*)`. On 64-bit macOS, pointers are 8 bytes but int is 4. The issues found and fixed:

- **Pointer-to-int casts in static initializers** (`m_misc.c`): The `default_t` struct stores string pointers as `int`, which truncates on 64-bit and isn't a compile-time constant in Clang.
- **Zone allocator alignment** (`z_zone.c`): Aligned to 4 bytes (32-bit), needs 8 for 64-bit pointer fields in `memblock_t`.
- **WAD struct layout** (`r_data.c`): `maptexture_t` has a `void**` field that's 8 bytes on 64-bit but the WAD binary format has 4 bytes, shifting all subsequent fields.
- **Hardcoded `*4` allocations** (`r_data.c`, `p_setup.c`): Arrays of pointers allocated as `count*4` instead of `count*sizeof(pointer)`.
- **Pointer alignment casts** (`r_data.c`, `r_draw.c`): `(int)pointer & ~0xff` truncates 64-bit addresses. Fixed with `(intptr_t)`.
